        <h2><strong><u>Our story</u></strong></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2020: We first met in the university in class NNA60DH1</li>
          <li>2021: The first year we actually stay together
            <p>At the beginning of 2021, we had our own interest in each other but we haven't gone any step further and remain friend</p>
            <p>Not until 25th June, I confessed my love to her and we officially become boyfriend and girlfriend</p>
            <p>The first year gone by and we have experienced things we never tried before. We also got to know and respect each other to avoid unecessary fight</p>
          </li>
          <li> 2022: The second year we got along
            <p>Our second year gone by with a lot happens such as:"Gaining weight, changing hair styles, changing dressing style, buying new phone,...</p>
            <p>We got our up and down but we still get through it together</p>
          </li>
          <li>2023: The third year was the hardest year we have experienced together
            <p>Our jobs has been changing so much lately, we got access to multiple different opportunities and salary was much better</p>
            <p>We started to spend money uncontrolably and got a huge debt in our hand</p>
            <p>We bought so many accessories such as few new phones, new tablet and new laptop</p>
            <p>But the good thing is we got through it together and finally learned a lesson about saving and spending responsibly</p>
          </li>
          <li>2024 and our story continue
            <p>We are glad that we made it through a total of 4 anniversaries together and still going strong, we had our ups and downs but still, our love isn't affected</p>
          </li>
